    "    <p>Marimo combines the power of Jupyter, Streamlit, ipywidgets (and more) in a reactive interface.</p>\n",
    "    <p>It also displays interactive Pandas DataFrames and you can query them with SQL.\n",
    "    <p><b>Key features</b>:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li><b>Reactive execution</b> — change one cell, and dependent cells update automatically (no manual re-runs).</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>No hidden state</b> — every execution is deterministic, making debugging easier.</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>Interactive UI elements</b> — add sliders, tables, and plots without callbacks.</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>Runs as a Python script</b> — parameterize it via CLI or deploy as an app.</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>Git-friendly</b> — stored as .py files instead of a messy JSON format.</li>\n",
